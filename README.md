### Programming AI for Strategic Gaming
Welcome to CodeCatch, an interactive Streamlit application that offers a unique blend of gaming and learning. This project is designed to provide an engaging and hands-on experience in understanding the concepts of reinforcement learning and game theory.

**Covered Algorithms:**
1. Q-Learning: An introduction to the fundamental reinforcement learning algorithm.
2. Deep Q-Learning: Delving deeper into the integration of Q-Learning with neural networks.
3. Fictitious Play in Zero-Sum Stochastic Games: Based on the paper "Fictitious Play in Zero-Sum Stochastic Games," this module explores the application of Q-Learning in a two-player scenario. This approach adds a strategic edge, simulating a real-world gaming experience.

**Created Resources:**
1. Models: Access to the core code of the algorithms.
2. Streamlit Application: An interactive web application to experience the algorithms in action. Check it out here:
